## Abstract

This HIP specifies a mechanism for locking up HBARs into an account such that those HBARs can be used only for rent payments for both the account and other state entities that designate the 
locked account as their autoRenewalAccount. By eliminating the possibility of a CryptoTransfer removing HBARs from a locked account and guaranteeing that any HBARs in the account be used 
only for rent payments, a locked account sends a strong signal of 'economic immutability' and so engenders confidence in the persistence and valuation of the state entities that
rely on the locked account for rent payments.

## Motivation

With Hedera turning on 'rent' for state entities like accounts, tokens, topics, and contracts , there is the (albeit likely small) potential for those objects to be
removed from state if rent is not paid. While mechanisms like stake rewards, token royalties, and contract fees can trickle HBARs into an account in order
to fund rent payments for both the account and connected state entities - nothing would prevent the owner of that account using their private key to transfer
those HBARs out of the account - and so effectively preventing future rent payments. 

Even just the possibility of rent payment failure and consequent state deletion may negatively impact the assurance and valuation that participants ascribe to 
Hedera state entities. 

There is therefore value in being able to guarantee rent coverage for state entities and to do so in a public & transparent manner such that participants can more easily 
asses the risk of rent deletion.

A locked account , one with no private key and so no ability to transfer HBARs, would provide such a rent guarantee for the other state entities that designate the locked account 
for renewal.

## Rationale

The Sustainability ecosystem building on Hedera creates provenance chains between HTS tokens representing ecological benefits like carbom removal or renewal energy credits 
and the physical reporting data that justifies the minting of the NFT instance. An enterprise considering buying such a carbon credit in order to offset their own
carbon emissions must be confident that they will be able to subsequently sell or 'retire' that NFT. 

If the token class for the NFT is deleted due to rent failure, then the ability to transfer any extant token instances will inevitably be impacted (details TBD). The
possibility of a token owner being unable to transfer theie carbon credit NFTs to a marketplace for sale, or to a smart contract for retirement, will negatively impact the 
value of their tokens.  All else being equal, an NFT for which the parent token class is at risk of rent deletion will be less valuable than one whose parent token class 
has rent visibly covered for a predictable period of time.

## Specification

Make setKey optional on the AccountCreateTransaction transaction.

## Backwards Compatibility

It is optional to create an account with no public key. Existing accounts that have key(s) will not be impacted.

## Security Implications

None?
